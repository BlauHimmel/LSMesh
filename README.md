# LSMesh
Least-squares Meshes

one of the Least-squares Meshes's implementation, and use it rebuild your 3d modal with high performance and low memory cost

the procedure is that first load the 3d modal, secondly select some control points which can show the trait of the area

then the modal will be rebuilt by these points and a traits matrix calculated in advance

the data structure I used are easy to understand, so you can change the data structure

to run the code,you need intel MKL library
